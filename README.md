# COS_214_Project
**Code breakers** 

## Introduction
This project was done for a module called Software Modelling (COS 214). This project is meant to strengthen our knowledge of design patterns. On completion of this project, we should be able to say with conviction that we as a group have completed a relatively large project and have experience of working in a relatively large design and development team. 

We broke the Spacex and Starlink simulation into 4 subsystems, namely Falcon rockets, Dragon spacecraft, Starlink Satellites and Launch simulator. We combined the first three subsystems in the last subsystem  “Launch Simulator”. A breakdown of these subsystems is listed in the project report [PROJECT REPORT](https://github.com/FaraiQC/COS_214_Project/blob/main/Report/COS214%20PROJECT%20REPORT.pdf).
